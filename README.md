Repository for my Fall23 STA445 Final Exam package

This repository contains the package I produced for my STA445 Final Exam at NAU Fall23. It contains a data frame of world population by country titled WorldPopulation, a data frame of World Cup hosts and attendance titled World_Cup, and a function titled CountryPopulation that can be used to build a graph of any country's population (as long as it is in the dataset). Enjoy!
